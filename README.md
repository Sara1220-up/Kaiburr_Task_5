# 🤖 Task 5 — Machine Learning Model Implementation (Kaiburr Internship)

This project implements a **machine learning pipeline** from dataset creation to model training and testing.  
The task focuses on building, preprocessing, and evaluating a predictive model using **Python** and **scikit-learn**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To design and execute a complete **data science workflow** — from data collection and cleaning to model training and evaluation — demonstrating proficiency in machine learning concepts and Python-based implementation.
